    <h1>Camille Wong (they/she)</h1>
    <p>Camille Wong was born in Oakland, California and holds B.A.s in Art and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara. They are a research-based artist invested in finding invisible dynamics of power embedded in technologies, social infrastructures, and the built environment. Their approach spans interactive websites, experimental video, sculpture, and writing, to reveal the extensive influence of power obscured within the texture of social spaces. Drawing from disciplines within digital humanities, urbanism, and experimental geography, their work observes how humans produce that space that in turn, shapes them.</p>
    <p>I am a first year MFA student in the Design Media Arts Department located within the School of Art and Architecture. For this class, I am excited to dive deeper into the possibilities of web mapping. In the Fall, I was enrolled in DH 131: Digital Web Mapping and Ciritcal Geographic Information systems which provided a broad overview of different mapping technologies and softwares. Continuing this mapping journey, I would love to have a more in depth understanding of web mapping technologies and the possibilities of programming for the web browser.</p>

    <p>Here a list of artists who have created maps that I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://nideffer.net/shaniweb/pigeonblog.php"><b>Beatriz DaCosta, <i>PigeonBlog</i></b></li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>This work was a collaborative effort between artists, engineers, and pigeons to collect air quality data in neighborhoods throughout Southern California. Using miniature air pollution sensors strapped to homing pigeons, these sensors measured pollutants in the air and transmitted the data to an online server, or blog, in real-time. This work engaged grass-roots scientific data collection and examined the potential of interspecies collaboration––asking in what ways could nonhuman animals participate in activities beyond the physical limitations of humans. Opening dialogue across technology, activism, and covert forms of oppression, these works are relevant to my practice because of its use of mapping and its critical examination of public infrastructure and spatialized racial class design.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/environmental-racism-in-death-alley-louisiana"><b>Forensic Architecture, <i>Environmental Racism in Death Alley, Louisiana</i></b></li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Using cartographic regression, remote sensing, and 3D modeling, this mapping project studies the heavily-industrialized neighborhood known as “Petrochemical Corridor” (previously known as “Plantation Country”) and located the erased burial sites of enslaved Black people. Locating these cemeteries would raise the territory to a federal historical site which would prohibit industrial development, and cease the emission of toxic air pollutants to neighboring communities.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><a href="https://paglen.studio/2020/04/09/landing-sites/"><b>Trevor Paglen, <i>Landing Sites</i></b></li></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Trevor Paglen is an artist that blurs the ines between social science, contemporary art, and investigative journalism to construct unfamiliar yet meticulously researched ways to interpret the world around us. In this piece, he located and photographed locations where the internet was the most congested. These were locations where multiple undersea cables reach land and connect with other continents. This is part of a larger project where he looks at material infrastructures of the internet and mass surveillance. </li>
            </ul>
