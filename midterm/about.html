        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>This project opens an investigation across publicly-funded stadiums in the United States under the four major professional sport leagues –– the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. Using case studies on four major U.S. stadiums: the T-Mobile Arena (Seattle, WA), Dodger Stadium (Los Angeles, CA), the SAP Center (San Jose, CA), and the RingCentral Coliseum (Oakland, CA), this project will follow the historical neighborhoods these stadiums were built in to chart their impact on the surrounding environment. It will ask not only how stadiums affect the demographics of the neighborhood –– including race, property value, and median family income, but also interrogate the sites of their construction. The purpose of this project is to analyze the neighborhood in which a stadium is built and the economic implications of public subsidies on professional sport facilities. Our method involves comparing data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation Redlining Grade Map. 
            This detailed analysis will illustrate the long-term effects of housing segregation in the United States and critically examine the redirection of public dollars on private stadiums.</p>

                <p>Camille is a first year MFA student in the Design Media Arts Department within the School of the Arts and Architecture. They hold B.A.s in Art and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara. They are a research-based artist invested in finding invisible dynamics of power embedded in technologies, social infrastructures, and the built environment. Their approach spans interactive websites, experimental video, sculpture, and writing, to reveal the extensive influence of power obscured within the texture of social spaces. Drawing from disciplines within digital humanities, urbanism, and experimental geography, their work observes how humans produce that space that in turn, shapes them.</p>
